#  I-KNOW-WHERE-YOU-LIVE / TERMINAIL

A comprehensive OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) profiling tool for educational purposes. Gathers publically available data about a subject based on name and context.

The tool was created for the [Cursor Hackathon](https://cursor.com/community) [Singapore](https://www.straitstimes.com/tech/programmers-assemble-400-compete-in-24-hour-hackathon-by-ai-firms-like-cursor-openai) held at the [Singapore University of Technology and Design](https://www.sutd.edu.sg/) on October 18-19 2025.

The creators of the tool are [Barna Marczali](https://github.com/barnamarczali) and [Csanad Budai](https://github.com/budaic).

The name of the project is a joke. ... or is it? Also, this was very heavily vibe-coded (using cursor).
