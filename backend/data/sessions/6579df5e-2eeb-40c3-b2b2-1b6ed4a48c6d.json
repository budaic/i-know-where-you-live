For realistic applications, these ML models consider the component-level characteristics that influence the network response during emergencies. However, such an approach could result in a large number of features and cause ML models to suffer from the \\`curse of dimensionality'. We present a clustering-based method that simultaneously minimizes the problem of high-dimensionality and improves the prediction accuracy of ML models developed for resilience analysis in large-scale interdependent infrastructure networks. The methodology has three parts: (a) generation of simulation dataset, (b) network component clustering, and (c) dimensionality reduction and development of prediction models.

The theme for this year is ‘Connections and Collaborations’, more specifically looking at:\n\n- How we ‘collaborate with specific user groups to co-create more relevant and inclusive library services’.\n- How we might ‘forge connections with external groups or individuals in order to improve both our processes and results’.\n- How we can ‘persuade senior managers and stakeholders of the value of UX work’.\n\nIf you know me personally, follow me on [Twitter](https://twit\n\nScore 1-10, determine if same person, list matching/conflicting elements.\n\nRespond with ONLY this JSON:\n{\n  \"relevancyScore\": 7,\n  \"isLikelyMatch\": true,\n  \"confidence\": \"high\",\n  \"reasoning\": \"Brief explanation\",\n  \"samePersonElements\": [\"element1\", \"element2\"],\n  \"differentPersonElements\": [\"element1\"]\n}\n\nRESPONSE:\n{\n  \"relevancyScore\": 7,\n  \"isLikelyMatch\": true,\n  \"confidence\": \"high\",\n  \"reasoning\": \"The source includes explicit references to Arun Verma as an author (Arun Verma1) on publications and a LinkedIn profile, plus a professional header mentioning Arun Verma as Vice President of Business Solutions, which strongly suggests it is about the same individual.
