## ⚠️ ACTION REQUIRED: Database Migration

Before using the system, you **must** run the database migration:

### Step-by-Step

1. **Open Supabase Dashboard**
   - Go to https://supabase.com/dashboard
   - Select your project

2. **Go to SQL Editor**
   - Click "SQL Editor" in the left sidebar
   - Click "New Query"

3. **Run Migration**
   - Copy contents of `supabase-setup-v2.sql`
   - Paste into SQL Editor
   - Click "Run" or press Cmd/Ctrl + Enter

4. **Verify**
   - Go to "Table Editor" → "profiles"
   - Should see new columns: `hard_context`, `soft_context`, `generated_context`, `search_logs`
   - Go to "sources" table
   - Should see new columns: `relevancy_score`, `validation_reasoning`, `confidence`

**Migration adds these columns without affecting existing data!**

## 🧪 Test the System

### 1. Open the App
Visit: http://localhost:3000

### 2. Create a Test Profile

Try this example:
```
Name: Linus Torvalds
Hard Context: Creator of Linux operating system
Soft Context: Active in open source community, maintains Linux kernel
```

### 3. Watch the Magic
- Form shows separate hard/soft context fields ✨
- After submit, profile creation starts
- Takes 2-3 minutes (4 phases)
- Progress shown in console

### 4. Explore the Results

Click through these features:
- **"Show Context"** → See hard, soft, and generated contexts
- **"Show Sources"** → See all sources with scores 6-10
- **"Show Search Logs"** → See all 4 phases in detail

Each source shows:
- 🔢 Score badge (color-coded)
- 🎯 Confidence badge (high/medium/low)
- 📝 Validation reasoning
- 🔗 Clickable URL

## 💡 Tips for Best Results

### Writing Good Hard Context
✅ "Software engineer at Microsoft"  
✅ "PhD student at Stanford studying AI"  
❌ "Works in tech" (too vague)  
❌ "Probably in California" (uncertain)

### Writing Good Soft Context
✅ "Active on Twitter, interested in blockchain"  
✅ "May have published research papers"  
✅ "Possibly contributed to open source"

### Choosing Good Test Subjects
- ✅ People with professional online presence
- ✅ Those with LinkedIn/GitHub profiles
- ✅ Public figures or academics
- ❌ Very private individuals
- ❌ Common names without context

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Backend Issues
```bash
# Check logs
cd backend
npm run dev
# Watch for errors
```

### Frontend Issues
```bash
# Restart
cd frontend
npm start
```

### Database Issues
1. Verify Supabase credentials in `.env`
2. Run migration: `supabase-setup-v2.sql`
3. Check table structure in Supabase dashboard

### No Results
- Verify `EXASEARCH_API_KEY` in `.env`
- Check OpenAI API key is valid
- Try a more well-known subject first

---

## 📊 What to Expect

### Timing
- Phase 1 (LinkedIn): ~10-20 seconds
- Phase 2 (GitHub): ~10-20 seconds
- Phase 3 (Website): ~10-20 seconds
- Phase 4 (5 queries): ~60-90 seconds
- **Total**: 2-3 minutes per profile

### Results
- **Sources**: 5-20 high-quality sources (6-10 scored)
- **Phases**: Usually 2-4 phases find results
- **Aliases**: 0-5 strict username format
- **Context**: LinkedIn/GitHub/Website summaries if found
