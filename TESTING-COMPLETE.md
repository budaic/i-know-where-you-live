## ⚠️ Expected Issues (Not Bugs)

### Supabase Connection Error
**Error Message**: "Request failed with status code 500"

**Why**: The Supabase database hasn't been created yet.

**This is EXPECTED** and not a bug in the code. The application is correctly attempting to connect to Supabase, but the database doesn't exist yet.

**Solution**: Follow the steps in `SETUP-CHECKLIST.md`

---

## 📋 What You Need to Do

To make the application fully functional, you need to:

### 1. Set Up Supabase (15 min)
- Go to https://supabase.com
- Create a new project
- Run the SQL from `supabase-setup.sql`
- Update `.env` with correct URL and key

### 2. Get Exa API Key (5 min)
- Go to https://dashboard.exa.ai/
- Generate an API key
- Add `EXA_API_KEY` to `.env`

### 3. Restart Servers (1 min)
- Stop both servers (Ctrl+C in both terminals)
- Restart backend: `cd backend && npm run dev`
- Restart frontend: `cd frontend && npm start`
